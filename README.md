# Markdown editor with React Classes

This is a very simple app I made to train with React classes, as I learned with hooks from the beginning.

## Marked.js

This app is using marked.js library, which is a markdown parser library. You can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked).

### How to test the app

Use yarn start to run the app.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
